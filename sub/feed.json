            "description": "WWDC20 is the first-ever all online Apple Event - and of course, the WWDC! This means all attendance to WWDC20 was online, so nobody had a conference badge. Conference badges, in my opinion, are objects with great sentimental value. They can remind you of the amazing time you had and the people you met. In my opinion, WWDC20 was even more special than other years, and it well deserves to have a badge.",
